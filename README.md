# CS52_Workshops

## Intro

This repository is for recording my work for all the workshops that I have done for CS 52: Full Stack Web Development at Dartmouth College during Spring 2018.

Through various workshops, I developed my skills in using Bootscrap and many other useful full stack web development tools.

Notice that most of the projects in the repository were not complete, because the goal of these workshops is to develop my skills and learn new skills rather than actually complete a project.
