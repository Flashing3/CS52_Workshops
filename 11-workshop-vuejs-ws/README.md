# CS52 Workshop, 5/15/18:  Vue.js

Vue.js is, quite simply, a framework for building user interfaces. Does that sound familiar?
It should, because that's the same thing that React does! In fact, you'll see Vue.js commonly
listed as an alternative to React or Angular. It's lightweight, fast, and
features components like React. Unlike React, Vue.js allows two way data binding
between your Javascript and the DOM.
