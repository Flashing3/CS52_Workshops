## Intro

In this workshop, I learnt how to use The Google Cloud Vision API.

"The Google Cloud Vision API allows us to understand the contents of an image. You can use it for label detection, logo detection, explicit content detection, face detection, image attributes, web detection, and more. But today, we are going to use the Google Cloud Vision API to identify an uploaded image using label detection (tagging an image with attributes and text recognition (OCR)."

I built a webpage which had two functionalities:

1.To identify a picture which has an object
2.To identify a picture has some texts in the picture
