# Intro

In this tutorial, I learnt about how to use Three.js, a tool to help create 3D visualized icon stuff on the webpage.

I did:

-Instantiated a canvas, camera, renderer
-Created a basic object using the geometry class
-Added a point light object to shine on the 3D object
-Learned how to animate the 3D object
-Introduced to some of the mechanics behind movement
